You awake in a prison cell with a guard watching you.
Suddenly, an arrow strikes the guard in the neck, killing him.
The door in the south opens, and a rock is thrown into your cell.
Tied to this rock is a key, and a note that reads "This key will open your cell. Open the cell, grab the guard's sword, and escape!"
