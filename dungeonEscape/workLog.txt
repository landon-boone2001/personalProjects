    Finished the readRoom function, reading in the room name, room desc, has encounters/has visited/is exit
    roomList.txt syntax:
        name
        desc
        exitDirection exitToRoom
12/4/22/7:05PM
    Finished the readEncounter function, reading in the Encounter title, encounter desc, isHostile/maxHealthChange/attackBonusChange/defenseChange
    encounterList.txt syntax:
        name
        desc
        isHostile check
        maxHealthChange
        currentHealthChange
        attackBonusChange

    Finished the readEnemy function, reading in the Enemy title, Enemy desc, maxHealth/currentHealth/defense/attackBonus
    enemyList.txt syntax:
        name
        desc
        maxHealth

12/4/22/8:01PM
    Finished AIcombat, rollHeal, RollAttack functions
12/4/22/8:52PM 
    Implemented room translation, victory condition (reached exit), room-based commands (IE noncombat commands), encounterList rolling into main file.
    if a player has entered a room for the first time ( besides the beginning room and the exit room) an encounter will be rolled.
12/4/22/9:58PM
    Implemeted combat and loss conditions.
12/4/22/10:49PM
    debugged issued with rolling random enemies. Implemented random events 1-10
12/4/22/11:39PM
    finished implementing the encounter list. beginning to implement a boss fight.
12/5/22/12:36AM
    finished implementing the enemy list and adjusting cout phrasing in the boss encounter.
12/5/22/2:03AM
    finished implementing roomlist and playtested. Put a limit on enemy heals because the final boss was very annoying.
12/5/22/2:23AM
    finished writing comments/reviewing code for errors.

    Fixed a compilation error on the tesla machine. For some reason .txt files created on my local machine didn't want to work with the tesla.
    Solution was to copy+paste all text from local files (CPP, H, TXT) into a new one on the tesla and compile. Compilation worked on the tesla,
    so I copied it to my local machine via SCP. It compiled on my local machine. Finally, I SCP'd it back to the tesla in a new directory, and I had no compilation errors.
    -----------------------------------------------------

    Writeup:
        I decided to go with making a dungeon crawler game 
        because some of my favorite game genres are roguelike exploration games.
        I am also a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons, and I always draw parallels between
        exploration-focused dungeon crawlers and D&D. In CS102, we created a basic multi-user dungeon, so I decided to expand on that framework
        in order to not only make a Multi-user dungeon, but to also implement a combat system between rudimentary AI NPC's and create random encounters,
        both hostile and nonhostile, and for each hostile random encounter, randomly selecting enemies in the same fashion a random encounter was drawn.
        These random encounters also can affect the player's temporal (current health) and permanent stats (Attack bonus, defense, max health).

        In the beginning of this project, I felt as if I bit off more than I could chew.
        I wasn't sure exactly how to get started with reading three different .txt files into the program and making sure
        all the stat allocations and event markers ended up where they were supposed to go, much less implementing a combat system.
        But once I got past the initial hurdles, I was able to understand quickly how to proceed through the project. From doing this project,
        I reinforced my understanding of working with objects of a class, and feel more confident using them in the future.

        Throughout this project, I had two major struggles: The smaller being missing small mistakes in code (IE  writingrand () % varName -2 rather than IE rand () % (varName -2) )
        that caused weird issues, such as creating a nameless enemy with 0 health but 200000 defense. 
        The biggest struggle I had was working with the tesla machine. I probably spent about the same amount of time debugging my program trying to
        figure out why I was having core-dump/seg fault issues on the tesla when copying all my documents and source code to the tesla machine.
        After about 15 hours off and on of working with this and trying various fixes, I finally decided to try something odd: making a new text document in the tesla, 
        and copying what I wrote on my local machine and pasting into the text document. This solved the compilation error, so I decided to try and repeat
        the process with each of my .txt files, my h file, and my cpp file, and the problem solved itself, I was able to SCP to and from the tesla machine
        without any compilation issues. I can only assume VScode somehow caused some weird translations to happen between my computer and the Tesla machines.

        Overall, this was a very fun project not only to write, but also to playtest and try and find the breakpoints of in order to make it more withstanding of the user,
        or to cut out elements that are more frustrating to the player than fun (IE enemies having infinite healing abilities - every enemy is now limited to 5 per encounter).
        I have probably spent at least 3 hours playing this game, trying various runs (making a bee-line to the exit, and exploring each and every room),
        with a different combination of events every time (Barring the final boss at the end of the dungeon, of course).

        What will be turned in to the final lab will be as follows :
        dungeonEscape.cpp
        Dungeon.h
        roomList.txt
        enemyList.txt
        encounterList.txt
        workLog.txt
        A map of the dungeon for quick grading (Although I would recommend exploring the whole place, as the final boss can be tricky without proper equipment).
